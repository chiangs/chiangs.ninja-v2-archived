    <h1>My projects</h1>
    <h2>Here's a sample of projects I have completed from an intensive bootcamp at Skill Distillery.</h2>
    <p>They range from low-level terminal run Java programs to more complex collaborative webapps in the span of just 16 weeks. These projects are hosted on GitHub and some are deployed to my Amazon Web Services server.</p>
    <p>Click on the icon to run the app or hover and click on description to get to the GitHub repository with more details of each project.</p>

    <h1>Presidents Web</h1>
    <h2>A collaborative project using servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP)</h2>
    <p>This project utilized servlets and data access objects (DAO) to query and serve information from a CSV translated to html via JSPs on presidents of the United States. The other challenge in logic was cycling through the end back to the beginning of
        the information to provide an uninterrupted user experience.</p>

<div class="inserts" id="inventory">
    <h1>Inventory Management Web-app</h1>
    <h2>An inventory management web-app using Java and the Spring MVC framework with CRUD functionality. </h2>
    <p>This is my first project utilizing Springs Model and View (MVC) that allows the user to manage inventory. Although this web-app implements session control, the database does not persist and reverts back to the original state of pre-loaded inventory
        when the server is restarted. This web-app is also largely mobile friendly and works on mobile devices.</p>

<div class="inserts" id="hr">
    <h1>Human Resources Management Web-app</h1>
    <h2>An employee management web-app using Java and the Spring MVC framework with CRUD functionality. </h2>
    <p>This is my first project incorporating a MySQL database and implementing session control. The web-app is also mobile responsive and data can be viewed/manipulated with most popular mobile devices. The database was created with MySQL Workbench and
        managed via command-line.</p>
</div>


<div class="inserts" id="trip">
    <h1>Travel Review Social Web-app</h1>
    <h2>A web-app for users who travel and wish to share reviews and ratings of places all over the world.  </h2>
    <p>This is a collaborative project developed with the Java JPA API, Spring MVC framework, and MySQL database technologies with CRUD functionality. This web-app implements session control, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM),
        Form Validation, and my first attempt at a login/logout security feature.</p>
    <p>JUnit tests were written to ensure proper mapping of the entities before moving from JPA to SpringMVC. Then tests were written for the DAO methods to ensure proper CRUD functionality and session persistence of a user. <br />**Login with username: '<b>test</b>', password: '<b>test</b>' to explore the web-app.**</p>
